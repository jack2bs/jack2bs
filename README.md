ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Jack Toubes!

I have a few of my projects (mostly embedded systems stuff) in this repository. I really appreciate you taking the time to check it out!

Some of my older projects are no longer accessible due to the passing of computers, but I've put as many as I can up here.

I can be reached at jack.toubes@princeton.edu with any questions or feedback.
